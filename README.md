# Car Evaluation with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates a professional implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying car evaluations. It covers the entire process, from loading and preprocessing a car evaluation dataset to training a KNN classifier and evaluating its performance.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Utilizes Pandas and scikit-learn to load a car evaluation dataset from a CSV file and preprocess categorical features.
- **KNN Classification:** Implements a KNN classifier using scikit-learn's KNeighborsClassifier.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the trained model's accuracy and provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions.

## How to Use
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip3 install pandas scikit-learn`.
2. Run the script: `python CarClassPredictor.py`.

## Dataset
The script uses the Car Evaluation Dataset, where features like buying price, maintenance cost, and safety are used to predict the acceptability class of a car.
